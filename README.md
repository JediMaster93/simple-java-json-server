# simple-java-json-server

## Explenation
This is a simple web server, it receives json data in this format
```

{
	"method": "add",
	"person": {
		"name": "Jakov",
		"age": "25"
	}
}
```

Then it adds the person object to the list of the server.
Right now server can only add, but I will implement getting, maybe filtering and adding multiple persons in one request.

## Usage
1. Download java 8
2. Run Server.java
3. Run Client.java (or send a request manually)
